# Refactoring using VBA for Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Refactoring is essential in making  coding more efficient and digestable. For Steve and his parents, this is important to analyze the dataset to include a overall view of the entire stock market over the last few years. 

The purpose of this exercise was to explore refactoring in preparation for analyzing larger data sets. 

## Results

As seen below, the stock performances in 2017 faired much better than those in 2018. Only TERP had a negative return  (-7.2%) while the other 11 stock tickers had positive returns ranging from about 10% to 200%. Although TERP had a greater return in 2018, it was still a negative one overall.
In 2018, only two stock tickers had positive returns, ENPH (81.9%) and RUN (84%) (also had positive returns in 2017, 129.5% and 5.5% respectively). All other stock tickers (10/12) had negative returns ranging from about -60% to -3%.

Overall, althgouh the refactored script presented more flow and future flexiblity in applying to larger data sets, the execution and troubleshooting was more outstretched than than executing and troubleshooting the original script. 

## Summary

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Some advantagres of refactoring code are:
- faster programming
- more fluid scripts of coding
- easily adjusted as more data is "added" and/or being assessed

Some disvantages of refactoring code are:
- can be time consuming and may need to constantly retests functionality and flow 
- if original scipt is not understood, refactoring can be done inproperly 


How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

These pros and cons apply to the original VBA script as when Steve's parents would like to look at only two years the analysis is easily digested when formulating the script - however, as time goes on, with more years to assess, the refactored code would suit the analysis better as it will allow multiple years of stock tickers to be compared.
